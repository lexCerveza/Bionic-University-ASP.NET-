The most popular of the BC Rich line is the BC Rich "Bich" 10 string model. 
The Bich 10 string guitar was the brain-child of Neal Moser. 
During the late 1960s, Moser worked with musicians including Jimi Hendrix, and Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills and Nash. 
The "Bich" can also be categorized as a guitar that "brings out" Heavy Metal and such genres.
