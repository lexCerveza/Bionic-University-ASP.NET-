A certain aura of mystique surrounds the Gibson Flying V. 
A guitar well ahead of its time when it was introduced in 1958, the Flying V’s intense magnetic appeal, powerful sound, and unusually familiar shape have made it one of the most instantly recognizable guitars in the world. 
Legendary Gibson President Ted McCarty was looking to add a futuristic aspect to the company’s image when he introduced the Flying V, and he nailed it. 
And while some of the greatest guitar players of all-time—including Lonnie Mack and Albert King—immediately embraced the Flying V, it wasn’t until Gibson reintroduced the guitar in 1967 that the rest of the world caught on. 
Guitar Gods like Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Winter, Billy Gibbons, Michael Schenker, and Lenny Kravitz have all succumbed to the Flying V’s fascinating allure.
